# React Library App - Front-End

The React Library App is a full-stack application developed using **React** and **TypeScript** on the front end, with a **Spring Boot** back-end service and MySQl/PostgreSQL in developement and production respectively. The app provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for interacting with a library system, enabling users to view, search, manage, and loan books. It also includes advanced features such as book reviews, user authentication, payment processing, and admin functionalities. The app is styled using **Bootstrap** to ensure a responsive and modern design.

## How to Run the Project Locally

To set up and run the React Library App on your local machine, follow these steps: 

1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/crentzos/Library-App-Frontend.git` and `cd react-library-app`.

2. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run `npm install` to install the projectâ€™s dependencies.

3. Start the Development Server: Run `npm start` to start the development server. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Login Credentials

For testing purposes, you can use the following credentials:

- **User Login**
  - Username: `oktauser@email.com`
  - Password: `okta1234`

- **Admin Login**
  - Username: `adminuser@email.com`
  - Password: `1920rockjazz`
 

## Deployment

The front-end application is deployed on Netlify. You can view the live application at [React Library App](https://my-react-library-app.netlify.app).

## Additional Information

The front-end is connected to a Spring Boot back-end service, which is deployed on Render. Ensure that the back-end service is up and running to fetch data correctly. If you prefer, you can also run the server locally by following the instructions in the README file available at [Library App Backend](https://github.com/crentzos/Library-App-Backend.git). When running locally, the back-end service will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/api.
