# React Library App - Front-End

The React Library App is a front-end application developed using React and TypeScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with a library system, allowing users to view, search, and manage books. The app fetches data from a Spring Boot back-end service and is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive design. This project was created to develop an intuitive and responsive library management interface that communicates seamlessly with a back-end service. It demonstrates proficiency in React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and modern front-end development practices. 

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Bootstrap**: A framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **CSS**: For custom styling and layout.
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the back-end.
- **Netlify**: For hosting and deploying the front-end application.


## How to Run the Project Locally

To set up and run the React Library App on your local machine, follow these steps: 

1. Clone the Repository: `git clone https://github.com/crentzos/Library-App-Frontend.git` and `cd react-library-app`.

2. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run `npm install` to install the projectâ€™s dependencies.

3. Start the Development Server: Run `npm start` to start the development server. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

The front-end application is deployed on Netlify. You can view the live application at [React Library App](https://my-react-library-app.netlify.app/home).

## Additional Information

The front-end is connected to a Spring Boot back-end service, which is deployed on Render. Ensure that the back-end service is up and running to fetch data correctly. If you prefer, you can also run the server locally by following the instructions in the README file available at [Library App Backend](https://github.com/crentzos/Library-App-Backend.git). When running locally, the back-end service will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
